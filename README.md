## Setup

We write our code with VSCode in this course, which you can download from the [Visual Studio website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

While it's possible to install and use Python in many different ways, we prefer the Anaconda distribution for setting up data science environments.
You can download it from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
The "Graphical Installer" is easiest to use.

Once you have Anaconda downloaded, you should set up a new environment using the `environment.yml` file present in this repository.
Anaconda ships with a program called Anaconda Navigator, which allows you to do this.
Open it (you can lauch it however you typically start applications), click on the "Environments" tab in the leftmost pane, and click Import at the bottom of the second pane.
In the dialog that follows, opt to use a file from your "Local drive" and then navigate to select the `environment.yml` file in this project folder.

If you have trouble getting set up, we can help you out in class.
